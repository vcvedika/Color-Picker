# Color-Picker
My first web development project
The color picker website shall display a random RGB value on top, three colored cards in easy mode and six colored cards in hard mode. One of the colored cards will be of the correct RGB value as displayed on the top. The rest of the cards will be of random RGB values generated by the program. On selecting the colored card that matches the RGB code displayed on top, the website will display all cards with the correct color and render "Correct!" on top. In contrast, if the card selected is wrong, the site will render "Try again", eliminating the wrong card you just picked.
